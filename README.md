# Game of Shapes

This game is built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The idea began from an exercise during a Code Fellows 4-week course. The game becomes interesting due to the random generated options. 
The objective of the game is to identify the number of circles or squares. The player will have up to three chances to make a correct guess. Good luck!
